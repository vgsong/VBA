# VBA

This repository is used as a quick reference guide for VBA which I use almost daily for MS Excel automation at work. Just putting together the ones I have found useful in the last 5 years of daily usage, as well as forgetting due to python taking most of the time. (and much easier!)

copyPaste.txt - Efficient method in transferring values from cell to cell.

findRowCol.txt - it searches for given string, and return the row/column number.

forEachCell.txt - Simple for each cell loop reference (More efficient than for loops (it depends)).

textToCol.txt - For refenrece when i need to use texttocol.

trowREF.txt - Used for to find last row/col from chosen col/row.
