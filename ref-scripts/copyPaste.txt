Sub foo()

' This is the best way to change values between existing ranges in workbook
' usually copy/paste method tries to imitate the actually COPY/PASTE command
' which is not efficient

' One effective way to copy/paste is to create two range objects
' and have them exchange values between them
' you can also exchange between workbooks 


Dim wb as workbook

' Source Range
Dim sRng as range

' Destination Range
Dim dRng as range

    
    ' Get all the data in the current region
    Set sRng = Sheet1.Range("A1").CurrentRegion

      ' where the data will be pasted/transferred
    Set dRng = Sheet2.Range("A1")

      ' Resize destination range to fit the data from source Range
    Set dRng = rgDest.Resize(rgSrc.Rows.Count, rgSrc.Columns.Count)

      ' Make the values in destination range the same as source range    
    dRng.Value2 = sRng.Value2
